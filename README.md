# Detailing Treatment Predictor (Practice Project)

## 🎯 Project Goal
This is a test project I created to become comfortable with writing **Python** code and using **Git/GitHub**. 

My focus is on practicing the logic required to build **AI Agents** that can eventually perform automated tasks for businesses, such as lead qualification and service prediction.

## 🧠 Current Functionality
This prototype acts as a basic logic engine for a car detailing business:
- It categorizes vehicles based on brand and production year.
- It uses .lower() data normalization to ensure user input is processed correctly.
- It predicts the most likely treatment request (Luxury, High-End, or Minimal).
- The predictions are based on client priorities, a client with a car made by a luxurious brand but with a very old production year that isnt a collectors item usually prioritizes the name over the quality. Therefor it predicts the same treatment as a client with a not so luxurious car and a slightly older model.

## 🛠️ Skills Practiced
- Python fundamentals (Variables, Lists, Input, If-statements).
- Data cleaning (Handling case-sensitivity).
- Version control with Git and GitHub.
